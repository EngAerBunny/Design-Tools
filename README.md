# Design-Tools
Tools used in the design phase of an UAV

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Conceptual Design:

Python program for MTOW Definition coupled with the design point
Trade-off and multi-objective studies done using NSGA2 to obtain the final configuration of the conceptual design

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Preliminary Design:

BET analysis of various propellers in order to have initial values from their performance. 
OpenVSP CAD Models used to determine the parasite drag of the UAV

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Detailed Design:

Aerodynamic Studies:

CAD Model of the complete aircraft with the rotors parallel/perpendicular to the flow
Excel file to sum up all the results obtained in the aerodynamic aera

Propulsion Studies:

CAD Model of the propellers analysed as well as the V22x7.2 rotor
Excel file to sum up all the results obtained regarding the propulsion studies

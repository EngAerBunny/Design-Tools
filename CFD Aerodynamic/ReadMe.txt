This folder contains the CAD moldes of the complete UAV used in Ansys Fluent

Due to the size of the files, only the CAD model can be easily shared in the repository. For the mesh and simulation files, contact one of the authors

To open the CAD models, use Ansys 19.2 and create a new project in the Workbench. Then, upload the file you want to use

One file has the rotors aligned with the booms (RotorsParallel) and the other has the rotors perpendicular to the freestream (RotorsPerpendicular)
